        'The Oxford Placement Test is computer adaptive, which means that the test adjusts the difficulty of questions based on the studentâ€™s responses. This makes it more motivating and ensures that it gives a more precise measurement than traditional placement tests. Answers are automatically marked after each task, giving you an instant result once the test is complete. The test is available in British and American English in four different combinations: 100% British English, 100% American English or a mix.',
